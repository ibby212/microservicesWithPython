Answer the three questions below. There are no right or wrong answers — we are looking for your reasoning, not a textbook definition. A few honest sentences are worth more than a long generic paragraph.

---

## 1. The "why"

You built a service with distinct layers: models, schemas, repository, service, and routes — each with a single responsibility.

**Why not just put everything in one file and call it done?**

Think about what happens six months later when someone new joins the team, or when you need to swap SQLite for PostgreSQL. What does the layered structure protect you from?

> *Your answer:*
> Putting everything in one file might work for a very small project, but it becomes difficult to manage as the application grows. Separating models, schemas, repositories, services, and routes keeps responsibilities clear and makes the code easier to maintain. If everything's in one file, swapping SQLite for PostgreSQL means digging through the whole thing. With layers you just touch database.py and repository.py and nothing else breaks.

## 2. Your choice

Each service owns its data exclusively — no other service is allowed to touch its database directly.

**Pick one entity your service owns (e.g. `User`, `Game`). What would go wrong if another service could write to that table directly?**

Give a concrete scenario, not a general principle.

> *Your answer:*
> If activity-service wrote directly to the games table, it could insert a game with missing fields and skip all our validation. The data ends up broken and our own endpoints start failing.

---

## 3. The tradeoff

You now have models, schemas, a repository, a service, and routes — five layers for what is essentially a CRUD service.

**For a system this small, what is the cost of all this structure?**

And at what point does the complexity start to pay off? Where is the tipping point?

> *Your answer:*
> The main cost of this structure is extra complexity and more files to manage, but the second someone else joins the project or you need to change something, it starts making sense. The tipping point is when more than one person touches the code.

*Keep this file. You will refer back to it during the oral presentation.*
